# TronKinect
This a game Called Tron V Snake. It takes elements from both the classic game Tron and the infamous game Snake. 
You must have an 360 Kinect to play this game. 
Instead of using a plain keyboard or controller to play this game, you use your body. 
This is the basis of human-computer interaction.

********CONTROLS***********
Left hand up // go left 
Right hand up // go right 
Both hands down// go down
Both hands up// go up

********Mechanics**********
If you touch your own trail - you die
If you touch your oponents tail - you die 
There is wrapping involved so if you go past one part of the screen you appear in the opposite opposite end but going in the same direction. 
If you catch the power up, your score increases and your tail gets longer. 
The game ends either when you eliminate your self or when you eliminate the other player 
You cannot turn in the oppositie direction because otherwise you would crash into your own tail.
